## Emoji!

As you might have noticed when going over our documentation we like emoji,
especially in our commit messages.
Inspired by [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) we like all our
commit messages to be preceded by an emoji. Using emoji on commit
messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention
of a commit with only looking at the emoji used. Refer to the table
underneath to see which emoji is appropriate for your commit.

| Emoji                     | Commit type                   | Code                      |
